Changes in version 1.0.5

   * Correcting plot axis label in plot
   * Cleaning S3 methods conflicts
   * Adapt class() functions to inherits()
   * Add functions of hht package (that might be archived in the future)
   HilbertTransform(), HilbertEnvelope(), InstantaneousFrequency(), and
   PrecisionTester()

Changes in version 1.0.4

   * Adding the approx.cor() function, that allows a correlation of data sets
   having a different sampling rate, via interpolation
   * Adding the check.emd() function, that provides a complete diagnostic for

   package: simple.ssa()
   * respace(), extricate(): definition of an error (to avoid duplication of dt values)
   * New data sets for examples
   * Change the extricate() function to use the definition of linear trend,
   cyclically-connoted residual, and nonlinear trend
   * Adding a new warning in the extricate() and pile.up() functions
   (checking the sorting of the dt values)
   * Debugging pile.up()

Changes in version 1.0.1
